                  At Abhyasa, we offer a well-rounded curriculum that ensures
                  you gain expertise in every stage of the VLSI design process.
                  Our training begins with RTL design, where you’ll learn how to
                  write Verilog and SystemVerilog code for digital circuits.
                  This foundational skill forms the backbone of all subsequent
                  design work in VLSI.

                  As you progress through the program, you'll delve into the
                  critical aspects of the physical design flow. You’ll learn how
                  to take a design from the abstract RTL stage to a
                  fully-realized chip layout, ready for fabrication. This
                  includes concepts like floorplanning, timing analysis, and
                  place-and-route, which are essential to ensuring the
                  functionality and performance of a semiconductor chip.
